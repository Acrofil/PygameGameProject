# My game information
##  Ghost Blaster v.0                                                                                                                                   
 - Game Objective - Collect 5 coins to level up, starting point level 0, end point reach level 5 without dying.
 - Two types of ghosts come from above:                                                                        
 - Type 1: Gray: They are following you whenever you go.                                                       
 - Type 2: Pink: They only fall down, but can do damage too                                                    
 - If any ghost touch you, you lose one of your lives and the ghost dissapear.                                 
 - On each level you gain, the ghosts are increased x 5 of each type are added to the game                     
 - When you kill ghost, coin spawns at the location where you killed it and starts falling down.               
 - In order to catch it you must wait for it to fall down to you.                                              
 - If you shoot another ghost the coin respawns at the new location. Sometimes would be necessary to do so.    
 - There is some kind of escape mechanism with the doors, with little delay between usage.                     
 - Goal is to reach level 5 without spending all your lives/hits.                                              
 - Bonus coin spawns at the start of the game at random location - Left or Right corner of the screen
